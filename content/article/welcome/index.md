In 2015, I launched into what has become the single most impactful bible study I have ever experienced. For some reason, I felt compelled to deeply dive into all the commands of Jesus, and write about each one. 

Different people have different numbers in regards to the ways they group the commands in the gospels, but there are roughly 40 to 50 unique instances where Jesus uses the command form of a verb, such as “Make disciples” or “Follow me.” The command form is especially interesting to me, because it is so clear in regards to Jesus’ desires for our actions and character. 

Perhaps the most famous command of Jesus is known as the Greatest Commandment. Jesus offered it in response to a direct question from the Pharisees, who asked Jesus what the greatest commandment was. Here is his whole response: 

“‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”

Jesus is quoting two references from the Mosaic law as a way to appeal to the deeply religious group to whom he is speaking, and in doing so, he establishes a beautiful way to communicate all of God’s truth in very few words. 

Now, it seems simple enough to read, but the more I read this commandment during my study, the more I continued to notice how much heavy lifting the word “love” is doing. If I don’t have an accurate understanding of the word “love” in this command, I won’t understand the first or second part, and may miss the meaning entirely. Second, this word love is a verb, not a noun. Jesus isn’t describing what love is, but instead he is imploring us to act.

As an English major, poet, and general writer, I understand that words act as “witnesses” for one another, the way that in trials, testimony is only valid if it is established by two or three witnesses. The word love cannot bear witness to itself, or it will become a relative term that anyone can use for any purpose they desire. This word love, in this command, was the ONLY verb used. I needed a second word to testify to its meaning in this context, and in my own life.

After much reading, prayer, and probing bible dictionaries, I believe one could substitute the word “welcome” in place of the word “love,” and the meaning would be the same. I believe the word “welcome” acts as a witness to the word “love,” establishing its “testimony” as true. 

“Welcome the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Welcome your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”

This word welcome helps me understand what love the VERB is to mean. What does it mean to love God? Welcome him into my heart. Welcome him into my soul. Welcome him into my mind. When he asks to come change my mind about something, I don’t deny him access; I instead welcome him as an honored and desired guest, as I would my best friend. I welcome his words as if they are true. I welcome his invitations, as if they are the best thing for me. In the same way, I welcome others into my life in the way that I myself would like to be welcomed. I welcome others by being generous, thoughtful, and honest, even when it can hurt, because those are all attributes of how I would like to be welcomed (and that I believe are universal in the way all people desire to be welcomed by another). 

Thinking about this great commandment to love God and love others in the light of welcoming God and welcoming others has been transformative for my relationship with God and with others for the last five years. Most of all, it is this attitude of welcoming God and others that has been the driving force behind many of my decisions ministerially and professionally. My long-term “guiding principle” IS welcoming God and welcoming others. If I was asking questions like “Does welcoming God’s wishes make sense right now?” or “Can I afford to welcome this person?” I could very well have missed out on incredible opportunities to grow God’s kingdom as well as deep friendship with both God and others. 

This kind of welcome does not come without a cost. The first mention of the word love in the entire bible comes when God tells Abraham to take his “beloved” son Isaac, his only son, and offer him as a sacrifice. Abraham welcomed God and his wishes into his heart, soul, and mind, and went to go sacrifice his son before God stopped him. Love and sacrifice are completely entwined; you cannot have one without the other. All welcome requires sacrifice. When I have welcomed God, it has come with a cost, and the same when I have welcomed others - but it is a cost that I have become not only willing to pay, but happy to pay, because I see what emerges.

Through this willingness to welcome God and welcome others, God has blessed me immensely, especially with opportunities to develop new relationships and initiatives that I could never have imagined. He introduced me to my wife Lyndee, inspired us to welcome three children (and counting), and gave us opportunities to have friendships with people all over the country and world. These God-inspired friendships have led to the creation of initiatives like Word of Mouth, Detroit Reverse, No Secrets, Cultivate, International Oasis, Connect the Nations, LifeChurch Auburn Hills, End Prejudice, and My COVID Response, not to mention the continual growth of new recovery communities within Celebrate Recovery, new branches within Abide Ministries, and new ministers going forth from The Master’s Christian Ministries, all of which I am deeply a part. Being part of just one of these endeavors would have been so exciting; to be part of so many continually reminds of the overflowing and abundant love of God.  

As I continue on my journey to live a life loving God and loving others, there is no more important word for me to remember each day and each moment than “welcome.” Whatever the moment, whatever the frustration, whoever the person, whatever the Holy Spirit prompting, whatever the sacrifice - welcome. And if you’re reading this, I encourage you to welcome God into all areas of your life, as well as welcome others as you would like to be welcomed. I expect it will transform you just as much as it has transformed me.
